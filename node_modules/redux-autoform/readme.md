Introduction
------------

Redux-Autoform is an UI agnostic library for dynamically generating [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form) out of metadata.

Supported UI frameworks
------------------------

- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/redux-autoform/redux-autoform-bootstrap-ui) (beta state)
- [Material-UI](https://github.com/redux-autoform/redux-autoform-material-ui) (beta state)

Demos
-----

- [Bootstrap demo](https://redux-autoform.github.io/redux-autoform-bootstrap-ui/demo.html).
- [Material-UI demo] (https://redux-autoform.github.io/redux-autoform-material-ui).


Docs
---

[Docs are available here](https://github.com/gearz-lab/redux-autoform/blob/master/docs-md/documentation.md).

Installing
---

    npm install redux-autoform

Using
---

####AutoForm ([source](https://github.com/gearz-lab/redux-autoform/blob/master/src/AutoForm.js))####

The main React component.

```js
import { AutoForm } from 'redux-autoform';
```
    
The `AutoForm` props are listed [here](https://github.com/redux-autoform/redux-autoform/blob/master/docs-md/documentation.md#autoform).

The 2 most important props `AutoForm` should receive is the `schema` and the `componentFactory`.

The schema represents the application domain. All entities, layouts and their metadata is contained in the schema. More information [here](https://github.com/redux-autoform/redux-autoform/blob/master/docs-md/documentation.md#schema).

The `ComponentFactory` is responsible for determining which React component to use for a given field metadata. `redux-autoform` doesn't have any built-in factory, for that you can use either
[Bootstrap](https://github.com/redux-autoform/redux-autoform-bootstrap-ui) (beta state) or [Material-UI](https://github.com/redux-autoform/redux-autoform-material-ui) (beta state).

Assuming Bootstrap, you can get the factories like this:
 
```js
import { EditComponentFactory, DetailsComponentFactory } from 'redux-autoform-bootstrap-ui';
```

Either one of these factories now should be passed as prop Autoform as described in the [docs](https://github.com/gearz-lab/redux-autoform/blob/master/docs-md/documentation.md).
    
Localization
---

AutoForm doesn't directly depend on localization, but both the Bootstrap and Material-UI factories do. So, if you're using these, this is what you should do:

- Install [numbro](http://numbrojs.com/). This is the library used for number localization.
- Install [moment](http://momentjs.com/). This is the library used for datetime localization.
 
```js
// import moment and numbro
import moment from 'moment';
import numbro from 'numbro';
 // import the localizers
 import { momentLocalizer, numbroLocalizer } from 'redux-autoform';
// if you are using react-widgets, which is used by default on the standard factories, you need to import it's localizer too:
import reactWidgetsMomentLocalizer from 'react-widgets/lib/localizers/moment';
// set up the localizers
momentLocalizer(moment);
numbroLocalizer(numbro);

reactWidgetsMomentLocalizer(moment); // THIS IS ONLY IMPORTANT WHEN USING BOOTSTRAP
```

Styles
------

The styling will depend on the UI you're using:

- [Adding styles for the Bootstrap UI](https://github.com/redux-autoform/redux-autoform-bootstrap-ui#styling)
- Adding styles for the Material UI (under development)

Building and running the demo locally
-------------------------------------

Redux-Autoform provides a really minimalist demo. In order to run the demo, run:

    npm run start
    
Now the demo should be available here: [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).
    
Running the tests
------------------

    npm run test // will run the Karma tests PhantomJS
    // OR
    npm run test-chrome // will run the Karma tests on Chrome
